## About Me

I am a student at **RevoU**, currently learning **Fullstack Software Engineering** with a strong interest in **Machine Learning**.

This hands-on experience with automation sparked my interest in deepening my software development skills.

Now, I'm pursuing my goal of becoming a **Fullstack Software Engineer** to contribute to the world of **AI**. Learning how to build end-to-end applications will help me make a meaningful impact in this exciting field.

## Current Learning Journey

I am currently studying **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. These core technologies are vital for building engaging, responsive, and efficient web applications, and I'm excited to dive deeper into their possibilities.
